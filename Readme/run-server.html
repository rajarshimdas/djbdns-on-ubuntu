<h1>How to run a DNS server</h1>
Here is how to set up your computer
so that it publishes your IP addresses.
If you're upgrading from a BIND DNS server,
you should follow the
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-server-bind.html">upgrade</a> instructions instead.
<p>
These instructions assume that you have already
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/install.html">installed</a> daemontools and djbdns,
and that <tt>svscan</tt> is already running.
</p><p>
1. As root, create UNIX accounts named <tt>Gtinydns</tt> and <tt>Gdnslog</tt>.
</p><p>
2. As root, create an <tt>/etc/tinydns</tt> service directory
configured with the IP address of the DNS server:
</p><pre>     tinydns-conf Gtinydns Gdnslog /etc/tinydns 1.8.7.200
</pre>
This directory contains logs and configuration files
that you will change later.
<p>
The IP address must be configured on this computer.
The IP address must not have a DNS cache or any other port-53 service.
One computer can run a DNS server alongside a DNS cache
as long as they are on separate IP addresses.
The standard setup for small networks
is to put a DNS cache
on a private address such as 127.0.0.1 or 10.53.0.1,
and a DNS server on a public address.
</p><p>
3. As root, tell <tt>svscan</tt> about the new service,
and use <tt>svstat</tt> to check that the service is up:
</p><pre>     ln -s /etc/tinydns /service/tinydns
     sleep 5
     svstat /service/tinydns
</pre>
<p>
4. Set up your desired DNS data, as described on the rest of this page.
</p><p>
5. Set up a public web page saying that your DNS server is powered by djbdns,
so that a
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> search
for <tt>powered djbdns</tt> will find your page in a few months.
These public statements will encourage other people to deploy djbdns,
provide djbdns support services,
and develop djbdns-related tools.

</p><h2><a name="replicate"></a>Replicating your DNS service</h2>
Here is how to set up a second computer as a DNS server
providing the same information as your first DNS server.
DNS caches around the Internet will try both servers (in a random order),
so they will receive answers even if one server crashes.
<p>
You don't have to set up two DNS servers.
Your DNS servers don't have to be more highly replicated
than your web servers, mail servers, etc.
As an extreme,
if you have just one computer for your web server, mail server, and DNS server,
then setting up a second DNS server is silly.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/third-party.html">Third-party DNS servers</a>
are almost always a bad idea.)
However, if you're running a large site with many services,
you should set up two DNS servers.
</p><p>
For concreteness,
these instructions assume that
your first DNS server is on IP address 1.8.7.200,
and that the second computer has IP address 1.8.7.201.
</p><p>
1. On the second computer, as root,
create UNIX accounts named <tt>Gtinydns</tt> and <tt>Gdnslog</tt>.
</p><p>
2. On the second computer, as root,
create an <tt>/etc/tinydns</tt> service directory
configured with the second IP address:
</p><pre>     tinydns-conf Gtinydns Gdnslog /etc/tinydns 1.8.7.201
</pre>
<p>
3. On the first computer, as root,
edit <tt>/service/tinydns/root/Makefile</tt>
to replicate <tt>/service/tinydns/root/data</tt>
from the first computer to the second:
</p><pre>     remote: data.cdb
             rsync -az -e ssh data.cdb 1.8.7.201:/service/tinydns/root/data.cdb

     data.cdb: data
             /usr/local/bin/tinydns-data
</pre>
Alternatively, if you don't have rsync:
<pre>     remote: data.cdb
             scp data.cdb 1.8.7.201:/service/tinydns/root/data.cdb.tmp
             ssh 1.8.7.201 mv /service/tinydns/root/data.cdb.tmp \
             /service/tinydns/root/data.cdb

     data.cdb: data
             /usr/local/bin/tinydns-data
</pre>
Now any changes made on the first computer
will be copied to the second.
<p>
4. On the second computer, as root,
edit <tt>/service/tinydns/root/data</tt> to remind yourself
that DNS data is replicated from the first computer to the second:
</p><pre>     # Do not edit data on this computer! data.cdb is copied from 1.8.7.200.
     # The following line protects data.cdb by stopping make.
     9
</pre>
<p>
5. On the second computer, as root,
tell <tt>svscan</tt> about the new service,
and use <tt>svstat</tt> to check that the service is up:
</p><pre>     ln -s /etc/tinydns /service/tinydns
     sleep 5
     svstat /service/tinydns
</pre>
<h2>Receiving delegations</h2>
There are two crucial steps in arranging for a name
to be delegated to and handled by your DNS servers.
There are separate web pages
explaining the two steps of this process in more detail for
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-com.html">.com and .net and .org</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-at.html">.at</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-br.html">.br</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-ch.html">.ch</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-de.html">.de</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-dk.html">.dk</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-fr.html">.fr</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-hu.html">.hu</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-it.html">.it</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-nl.html">.nl</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-no.html">.no</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-ru.html">.ru</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-us.html">.us</a>,
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-arpa.html">.in-addr.arpa</a>,
and
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dot-local.html">local names</a>.
Other top-level domains include
.aero,
.biz,
.coop,
.edu,
.gov,
.info,
.int,
.mil,
.museum,
and
.name.
<p>
First, your server needs to accept the delegation.
Your server will not answer questions about a name
unless it knows that it is in charge of that name.
The following commands tell the server that it is in charge
of all names ending with <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> and <tt>7.8.1.in-addr.arpa</tt>:
</p><pre>     cd /service/tinydns/root
     ./add-ns heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.200
     ./add-ns heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.201
     ./add-ns 7.8.1.in-addr.arpa 1.8.7.200
     ./add-ns 7.8.1.in-addr.arpa 1.8.7.201
     make
</pre>
These commands also tell the server
<ul>
<li>to advertise
<tt>a.ns.heaven.af.mil</tt> with IP address 1.8.7.200
and <tt>b.ns.heaven.af.mil</tt> with IP address 1.8.7.201
as the <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> DNS servers, and
</li><li>to advertise
<tt>a.ns.7.8.1.in-addr.arpa</tt> with IP address 1.8.7.200
and <tt>b.ns.7.8.1.in-addr.arpa</tt> with IP address 1.8.7.201
as the <tt>7.8.1.in-addr.arpa</tt> DNS servers.
</li></ul>
<p>
Second, the parent server needs to delegate the name
to your servers.
Caches around the Internet
will not ask your server about a name
unless that name
has been delegated
to your servers.
In the above example,
</p><ul>
<li>the administrator of <tt>af.mil</tt>
needs to delegate <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> to
the server <tt>a.ns.heaven.af.mil</tt>
running on IP address 1.8.7.200
and the server <tt>b.ns.heaven.af.mil</tt>
running on IP address 1.8.7.201,
and
</li><li>the administrator of <tt>8.1.in-addr.arpa</tt>
needs to delegate <tt>7.8.1.in-addr.arpa</tt> to
the server <tt>a.ns.7.8.1.in-addr.arpa</tt>
running on IP address 1.8.7.200
and the server <tt>b.ns.7.8.1.in-addr.arpa</tt>
running on IP address 1.8.7.201.
</li></ul>
<p>
To avoid triggering a
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/bugtraq/20000112082807-15140-qmail@cr-yp-to">BIND bug</a>,
the parent server must use the <tt>a.ns</tt> and <tt>b.ns</tt> names,
not alternate names with the same IP addresses.
You can
tell <tt>tinydns</tt> to use different names;
in that case,
the parent server
will have to use those names.
</p><h2><a name="add-host"></a>Publishing addresses of your computers</h2>
Once a name such as <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt>
has been delegated to your servers,
you can publish an IP address for <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt>
and for any name ending with <tt>.heaven.af.mil</tt>.
<p>
Common practice is to set up two types of names:
</p><ul>
<li>Computer names.
Choose a name for each computer,
and run <tt>add-host</tt> with the computer's name and IP address.
You also have to tell the computer to
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ifconfig.html">respond</a>
to that IP address.
</li><li>Service names.
For each service (<tt>www</tt>, <tt>pop</tt>, etc.),
run <tt>add-alias</tt>
with the service's name and IP address.
</li></ul>
Distinguishing computer names from service names
is helpful if you decide later
to move a service from one computer to another.
<p>
For example,
let's say you're the <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> administrator;
you have three computers, with IP addresses 1.8.7.4, 1.8.7.5, and 1.8.7.6;
you have a web server running on the first computer;
and you have an FTP server running on the first computer.
You could name the computers <tt>lion</tt>, <tt>tiger</tt>, and <tt>bear</tt>,
and run the following commands:
</p><pre>     cd /service/tinydns/root
     ./add-host lion.heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.4
     ./add-host tiger.heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.5
     ./add-host bear.heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.6
     ./add-alias www.heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.4
     ./add-alias ftp.heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.4
     make
</pre>
The <tt>add-host</tt> and
<tt>add-alias</tt> programs edit the file
<tt>/service/tinydns/root/data</tt>,
which is in
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns-data.html"><tt>tinydns-data</tt> format</a>.
<tt>make</tt> runs the
<tt>tinydns-data</tt> program
to tell <tt>tinydns</tt> about the new information.
If anything goes wrong,
<tt>tinydns-data</tt> prints an error message,
and <tt>tinydns</tt> continues providing the old information.
<p>
Now anyone around the Internet
looking up <tt>lion.heaven.af.mil</tt>
or <tt>www.heaven.af.mil</tt>
or <tt>ftp.heaven.af.mil</tt>
will see IP address 1.8.7.4.
Anyone looking up the computer name for 1.8.7.4
will see <tt>lion.heaven.af.mil</tt>.
</p><p>
As an alternative to <tt>add-host</tt> and <tt>add-alias</tt>,
you can edit <tt>/service/tinydns/root/data</tt> manually,
adding the following lines:
</p><pre>     =lion.heaven.af.mil:1.8.7.4
     =tiger.heaven.af.mil:1.8.7.5
     =bear.heaven.af.mil:1.8.7.6
     +www.heaven.af.mil:1.8.7.4
     +ftp.heaven.af.mil:1.8.7.4
</pre>
There are two reasons to use
the <tt>add-host</tt> and <tt>add-alias</tt> programs
instead of editing <tt>data</tt> manually.
First,
<tt>add-host</tt>
will prevent you from accidentally reusing a previous computer name,
or reusing a previous computer IP address.
Second,
if you want to protect <tt>data</tt> against a sudden power outage,
you have to copy it to <tt>data.tmp</tt>, edit <tt>data.tmp</tt>,
sync <tt>data.tmp</tt> to disk,
and use <tt>mv</tt> to rename <tt>data.tmp</tt> as <tt>data</tt>;
<tt>add-host</tt> and <tt>add-alias</tt> do all this automatically.
<p>
<b>More on choosing names.</b>
You should end up running <tt>add-host</tt>
exactly once for each IP address,
giving a different computer name to each IP address.
You should not run <tt>add-alias</tt> for a computer name;
there should be exactly one IP address for the computer name.
</p><p>
Here are some good sources of computer names:
</p><ul>
<li>Animals: lion, tiger, bear, etc.
But don't use these if you're a biologist studying animals!
Computer names should be words that you don't normally use in other contexts.
</li><li>Planets: mercury, venus, mars, etc.
But don't use these if you're an astronomer!
</li><li>Deities: zeus, athena, hermes, etc.
</li><li>Elements: hydrogen, helium, lithium, etc.
</li><li>Flowers: tulip, rose, lilac, etc.
</li></ul>
<p>
If you add a second IP address to a computer,
it's generally a good idea to use <tt>add-host</tt> with a new name,
as if the second IP address were actually on a separate computer:
</p><pre>     ./add-host zebra.heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.240
</pre>
Then you won't have to change anything
if that IP address is, in fact, moved to a separate computer.
<h2><a name="testing"></a>Checking addresses of your computers</h2>
Here is how to systematically verify that
<tt>tinydns</tt> is publishing the right IP address for a name:
for example, that it is publishing IP address 1.8.7.4
for <tt>www.heaven.af.mil</tt>.
<p>
First, check that the address is in <tt>/service/tinydns/root/data</tt>
in <tt>tinydns-data</tt> format:
</p><pre>     +www.heaven.af.mil:1.8.7.4
</pre>
IP addresses can be assigned by <tt>+</tt> lines,
<tt>=</tt> lines,
<tt>@</tt> lines,
<tt>.</tt> lines,
and
<tt>&amp;</tt> lines.
<p>
Second, use <tt>tinydns-get</tt> to check
that the address is in <tt>/service/tinydns/root/data.cdb</tt>:
</p><pre>     cd /service/tinydns/root
     tinydns-get a www.heaven.af.mil
</pre>
The output will have a line saying
<pre>     answer: www.heaven.af.mil 86400 A 1.8.7.4
</pre>
although perhaps with a number other than 86400.
Common reasons that this answer is missing or obsolete:
you didn't run <tt>make</tt> after changing <tt>data</tt>;
you don't have <tt>.</tt> lines (or <tt>Z</tt> lines) in <tt>data</tt>
specifying relevant name servers.
<p>
If you want to check reverse lookups,
replace <tt>a www.heaven.af.mil</tt>
with <tt>ptr 4.7.8.1.in-addr.arpa</tt>.
</p><p>
Third, check that the IP address of <tt>tinydns</tt>
is one of this computer's addresses:
</p><pre>     cat /service/tinydns/env/IP
     netstat -n -i
</pre>
<p>
Fourth, check that the <tt>tinydns</tt> service is up:
</p><pre>     svstat /service/tinydns
</pre>
If <tt>tinydns-get</tt> reported more than 512 bytes,
you also need
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tcp.html">TCP service</a>;
check that the <tt>axfrdns</tt> service is up.
<p>
Fifth, ask <tt>tinydns</tt> about the name:
</p><pre>     dnsq a www.heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.200
     dnsq a www.heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.201
</pre>
Here <tt>1.8.7.200</tt> and <tt>1.8.7.201</tt>
are the IP addresses of your DNS servers.
The output of <tt>dnsq</tt> should be identical
to the previous output of <tt>tinydns-get</tt>.
<p>
Sixth, ask your DNS cache for the address:
</p><pre>     dnsqr a www.heaven.af.mil
</pre>
If <tt>dnscache</tt> can't find the address,
the problem is almost certainly that
the parent servers haven't delegated the relevant domains
to your <tt>tinydns</tt>.
Read the log in <tt>/service/dnscache/log/main/current</tt>
to see which servers <tt>dnscache</tt> is contacting
and what information they are providing.
For a thorough debugging scan,
use <a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/debugging.html#dnstrace"><tt>dnstrace</tt></a>.
<p>
Do not use
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/nslookup.html">nslookup</a>
to test your DNS servers.
</p><h2>Publishing mail server addresses</h2>
When an Internet mail transfer agent
wants to deliver mail addressed to <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt>,
it looks up the IP address of <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt>,
and tries to connect to an SMTP server at that IP address.
You can use <tt>add-mx</tt> to specify a different IP address:
<pre>     cd /service/tinydns/root
     ./add-mx heaven.af.mil 1.8.7.193
     make
</pre>
(<tt>mx</tt> stands for ``mail exchanger.'')
As an alternative to <tt>add-mx</tt>,
you can edit <tt>data</tt> manually,
adding the following line:
<pre>     @heaven.af.mil:1.8.7.193:a
</pre>
If you add several mail servers for <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt>,
use <tt>a</tt> for the first, <tt>b</tt> for the second, etc.
<tt>add-mx</tt> handles this automatically.
<h2><a name="add-childns"></a>Delegating names to another server</h2>
To delegate a name to a child server,
run <tt>add-childns</tt> with the name being delegated
and the IP address of the child server:
<pre>     cd /service/tinydns/root
     ./add-childns elysium.heaven.af.mil 1.2.3.144
     make
</pre>
As an alternative to <tt>add-childns</tt>,
you can edit <tt>data</tt> manually,
adding the following line:
<pre>     &amp;elysium.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.144:a
</pre>
If you delegate <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> to several IP addresses,
use <tt>a</tt> for the first, <tt>b</tt> for the second, etc.
<tt>add-childns</tt> handles this automatically.
<p>
You can select a server name
other than the default <tt>a.ns.elysium.heaven.af.mil</tt>.
To avoid triggering a
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/bugtraq/20000112082807-15140-qmail@cr-yp-to">BIND bug</a>,
the parent server and the child server
must use the same name for the child server.
For example, if the child server is using
</p><pre>     .elysium.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.144:dns1.elysium.heaven.af.mil
</pre>
then the parent server must use the same name:
<pre>     &amp;elysium.heaven.af.mil:1.2.3.144:dns1.elysium.heaven.af.mil
</pre>
Omit the IP address
if the name already has an IP address assigned in another <tt>data</tt> line:
<pre>     &amp;elysium.heaven.af.mil::dns1.elysium.heaven.af.mil
</pre>
<h2><a name="independent">Setting up independent DNS servers</a></h2>
You can run several servers (on different IP addresses)
with different <tt>data</tt> files.
For example, you could set up four servers,
with two servers publishing <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> information,
and two servers publishing <tt>panic.mil</tt> information.
Changes to <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt>
would be made on the first server and copied to the second.
Changes to <tt>panic.mil</tt>
would be made on the third server and copied to the fourth.
<p>
Of course,
a single server can publish both <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> and <tt>panic.mil</tt>.
However, if you have a gigabyte of DNS data,
you should consider running several independent servers,
each with a fraction of the data.
</p><h2><a name="move-zone">Moving a zone to an independent DNS server</a></h2>
Here is how to move <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt>
from two DNS servers on IP addresses 1.8.7.200 and 1.8.7.201
to two independent DNS servers on IP addresses 1.8.11.50 and 1.8.11.51.
<p>
1. Copy all the <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> data
from the old servers to the new servers.
</p><p>
2. On the new servers,
change the IP address of <tt>a.ns.heaven.af.mil</tt>
from 1.8.7.200 to 1.8.11.50,
by changing
</p><pre>     .heaven.af.mil:1.8.7.200:a
</pre>
to
<pre>     .heaven.af.mil:1.8.11.50:a
</pre>
in <tt>/service/tinydns/root/data</tt>.
Similarly,
change the IP address of <tt>b.ns.heaven.af.mil</tt>
from 1.8.7.201 to 1.8.11.51.
Type
<pre>     make
</pre>
so that the new servers start publishing the new IP addresses.
<p>
3. Make the same changes on the parent servers.
</p><p>
4. Make the same changes on the old servers.
This is important because caches can continue talking to the old servers
for any length of time;
caches are under no obligation to double-check with the parent servers.
</p><p>
5. Wait a few days for caches to stop contacting the old servers.
If you make any changes to the <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> data during this time,
make the same changes on the old servers.
</p><p>
6. Remove the <tt>heaven.af.mil</tt> data from the old servers.
That's it.
