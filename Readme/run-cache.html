<h1>How to run a cache on a workstation</h1>
Here is how to set up your computer
so that it can find addresses of Internet hosts.
Exceptions:
<ul>
<li>If your computer has a slow Internet connection,
you should use the
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-cache-home.html">home computer</a> instructions instead.
</li><li>If you want your computer to find addresses
on behalf of other computers on your network,
you should use the
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-cache-x.html">external cache</a> instructions instead.
</li><li>If your computer is running a DHCP client
to obtain a dynamically assigned IP address from your ISP,
and if your DHCP client cannot be configured
to discard external DNS cache information,
you will have to use the
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/run-cache-none.html">no-cache instructions</a>
instead.
</li></ul>
These instructions assume that you have already
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/install.html">installed</a> daemontools and djbdns,
and that <tt>svscan</tt> is already running.
<p>
1. Check that your computer can talk to DNS servers around the Internet:
</p><pre>     dnsq a www.aol.com 192.203.230.10
     dnsq a www.aol.com 192.48.79.30
</pre>
Normally each <tt>dnsq</tt> command will instantly print various lines
such as ``authority: aol.com 172800 NS dns-07.ns.aol.com.''
If <tt>dnsq</tt> instead pauses for a minute and prints ``timed out,''
your computer is not properly attached to the Internet
(or some of the Internet's central servers are down, which is unlikely).
You may have a firewall interfering with your computer's Internet access;
if so, tell your firewall to allow UDP and TCP
from this computer's ports 1024 through 65535
to any computer's port 53.
<p>
2. As root, create UNIX accounts named <tt>Gdnscache</tt> and <tt>Gdnslog</tt>.
</p><p>
3. As root, create an <tt>/etc/dnscache</tt> service directory:
</p><pre>     dnscache-conf Gdnscache Gdnslog /etc/dnscache
</pre>
This directory contains logs and a few configuration files
that you can change later.
<p>
4. As root, tell <tt>svscan</tt> about the new service,
and use <tt>svstat</tt> to check that the service is up:
</p><pre>     ln -s /etc/dnscache /service/dnscache
     sleep 5
     svstat /service/dnscache
</pre>
<p>
5. If your computer is running a DHCP client
to obtain a dynamically assigned IP address from your ISP,
configure the DHCP client to discard external DNS cache information.
</p><p>
6. As root, put
</p><pre>     nameserver 127.0.0.1
</pre>
into <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>,
replacing any previous <tt>nameserver</tt> lines.
You can skip this step if there are no <tt>nameserver</tt> lines
or if <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> doesn't exist.
<p>
7. Check whether you can look up addresses of some Internet hosts:
</p><pre>     dnsip www.cnn.com
     dnsip www.fsf.org
</pre>
Then try surfing the web.
If you want to see what <tt>dnscache</tt> is doing behind the scenes,
read <tt>/service/dnscache/log/main/current</tt>.
<p>
8. Set up a public web page saying that your DNS cache is powered by djbdns,
so that a
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> search
for <tt>powered djbdns</tt> will find your page in a few months.
These public statements will encourage other people to deploy djbdns,
provide djbdns support services,
and develop djbdns-related tools.
